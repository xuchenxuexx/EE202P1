# Repository for EEM202A Fall 2019 UCLA
# Project Topic: A Pedestrian Alert System using “earables”

__Team Member:__ Xuchen Xue, Jingjie Wu

__Abstrict__ 

In this project, we will develop a Pedestrian Alert System that alerting pedestrians if there are unseen cars approaching. We will use multiple microphones (at least 2) to detect the direction of the car. Also, we will track the position of head via eSense earables with in-build IMUs. Finally, we'll compare the direction of the car and the direction of pedestrians to decide if we need to alert user about approaching car.

  * Puechase Requirement (GitHub Page: https://github.com/xuchenxuexx/EEM202A_Final_Project/blob/master/Docs/PurchaseRequirement.md)
  
__Timeline__ 
  * Week 4: Read papers and discuss with professor with detail process
  * Week 5: Learn algorithm to train data and sound detection, have hardware setup.
  * Week 6: Collecting enough audio sample and train data, develop Android app with eSense earables.
  * Week 7: Finish car noise detection and start to develop car direction detection
  * Week 8: Keep developing car direction detection and finish Android app development with eSense earables.
  * Week 9: Finish car direction detection and start to integrate everything on Android app
  * Week 10: Finish developing Pedestrian Alert System and record demo video.

__Success Metrics__

When a car is approaching pedestrian,  Pedestrian Alert System is able to recognize car noise from all other noise.
After detect the noise of car, determine the direction of approaching car with multiple  microphones.
Design an Android app that can determine the position of hard with eSense earables in-build IMU
Alert user if approaching car is out of the user's vision
