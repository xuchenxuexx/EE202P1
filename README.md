# Repository for EEM202A Fall 2019 UCLA
# Project Topic: A Pedestrian Alert System using “earables”

__Team Member:__ Xuchen Xue, Jingjie Wu

__Abstract__ 

In this project, we will develop a Pedestrian Alert System that alerting pedestrians if there are unseen cars approaching. We will use multiple microphones (at least 2) to detect the direction of the car. Also, we will track the position of head via eSense earables with in-build IMUs. Finally, we'll compare the direction of the car and the direction of pedestrians to decide if we need to alert user about approaching car.
